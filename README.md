üß† ArticuLearn: AI-Powered Speech Therapy System for Children
ArticuLearn is a personalized, AI-driven speech therapy system designed to support children with various speech sound disorders, including articulation disorders, phonological disorders, childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), and fluency issues like stuttering. This intelligent mobile platform integrates advanced machine learning models (LSTM, CNN, DNN), feature extraction techniques like MFCC, and interactive digital tools to enable real-time error detection, targeted therapy exercises, and progress tracking.

üîç Key Features:
Real-time articulation error detection using MFCC + neural networks.

Phonological disorder classification through LSTM-based models.

Fluency monitoring and stuttering detection with audio augmentation and Bi-LSTM.

CAS intervention using dynamic time warping, attention mechanisms, and reinforcement learning.

Adaptive therapy module with phoneme-specific tasks and difficulty scaling.

ArticuLearn bridges clinical expertise and intelligent automation to enhance speech therapy accessibility and effectiveness, especially in resource-limited settings.
